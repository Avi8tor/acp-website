## Overview -- MASTER BRANCH

Redesign of the Arcade Creek Project public website.

Team:

Check out the Wiki for updates and resources. Also, the Wiki will contain notes on the structuring and setup of the redesign.

Use the issue tracker to submit ideas, features, etc for team consideration.

How to Work on this Project:
Start by forking the repository to your account. This gives you a personal copy of the project that you can work on whenever you want. When you create new features, add code, fix bugs, etc and feel that your work should be added to the main project, create a pull request to submit your code to the Web Senior Manager for consideration. The entire team can evaluate code, but the Web Senior Manager is responsible for managing the full project.

You'll note that this repo has two branches: the master branch tracks the code that is currently up on the website, while the redesign branch tracks the updated code. Eventually, the goal is to merge these branches, with the redesign code becoming the code that's up on the website. For now, this means changes to the current website should be made on the master branch, and redesign code should be on the redesign branch.
